# Stock-Market-Analysis
A project made for me to do some exploratory data analysis on stock market data that will evolve overtime and eventually predict stock movements. 
These will include common data mining techniques and my own spin on the algorithms for research purposes and just exploring the data. This is to determine which stocks I personally want to invest in for my own moneys long term growth instead of just leaving it sitting in my bank account because of the dramatic rise in inflation the psat few years.
